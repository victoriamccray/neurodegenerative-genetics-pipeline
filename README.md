# Neurodegenerative Disorders and Genetics Pipeline
A replication of computational methods used in the paper "Comparative Analysis of Multiple Neurodegenerative Diseases Based on Advanced Epigenetic Aging Brain" by Shi and colleagues.

The `gene_data_model.py` file initializes the loading of supplemental data and materials available from the paper: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2021.657636/full

The program reads a text file comprised of cpg sites and gene indexes into a dictionary, and provides simple calculations (such as unique gene set count).
